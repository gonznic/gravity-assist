## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>

**Gravity Assist** is a space-based arcade game coded in **Java** using the **Processing** Java Library. 
  
The objective of the game is to launch your ship from the home planet, which is the planet at the bottom of the screen, to the target planet, which appears at the top of the screen. Once the player aims and launches the ship, they cannot alter the ship’s trajectory. There are stars between both planets that must be used to swing the ship in the right direction. A player loses if the ship reaches a screen boundary or collides with a black hole, depicted by an orange circle. The player wins by landing the ship on the target planet. Doing so, increases the player’s score and moves them to the next target.
